Original script: speedup2.R
New scripts: 
function.R consists of functions.  
experiment.R consists of simulations.

Change log:
1. change matrix multiplication in g() and Hessi() --> avoid explicit construction of diagonal matrices for better memory allocation and faster computation
2. use ttl in place of ttm --> better memory allocation 
3. merge fit_ordinal() and fit_ordinal2()
4. update core tensor first, then update factor matrices --> output satisfies constraints....
5. add fit_ordinal_cp() for cp low-rank tensors
6. reformat rTensor objects into array class
7. allow missing values (i.e. tensor entries < 0)
8. orthogonalize factor matrices after each update --> better numerical stability; identifiable up to rotation

To-do:
1. allow K ordinal levels
2. speed-up BIC search? 
3. further speed-up?
4. Tucker vs. CP?
5. verify the non-convexity in intercept and slope jointly? 
6. allow signal tensor of rank 1
